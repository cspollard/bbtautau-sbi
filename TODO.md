TODOs
-----
- need the reweight function to take also the _weights_ as inputs for kL
  reweighting!
- implement normalizing flows
- uncertainty on e.g. sumET in top?
- jES/jER and uncertainties
- event-wide transformer?
- faster data loading
- tau- and b-tagging
- fake taus and b-jets
- train discriminant + binned likelihood fit (or marginalize?)
- kL vs xsec posteriors
- add discriminator loss component that decays to zero after many steps (to help
  with convergence)

Things to check
---------------
- what are per-jet and per-event features in sig and bkg?
- are backgrounds correct? make some plots...
- coverage
