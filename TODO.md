TODOs
-----
- class to handle dataset building?
  - can this be generalized?
- implement normalizing flows
- uncertainty on e.g. sumET in top?
- uncertainties on bkg fractions


Things to check
- impact of jES/jER
- impact of tau- and b-tagging
- what are per-jet and per-event features in sig and bkg?
- impact of other bkgs
